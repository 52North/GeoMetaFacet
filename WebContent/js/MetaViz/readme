MetaViz - Visualizing lineage information in a graph
----------------------------------------------------

This widget is available for GLUES project metadata stored in smart.finder specific database
or for preprocessed data stored in the hsql db.
Actually, the HSQL mode (usage of internal db) is set. To reset this, change source code: mode = "hsql"; in metaviz.js

Requests to the external project database are limited to internal LAN usage only.
In case of questions, please contact christin.henzen@tu-dresden.de

Otherwise the widget's backend classes (Java) have to be reconfigured for file mode (requesting data from an xml file) or
CSW mode.
