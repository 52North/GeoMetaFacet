Contributor License Agreement

52°North requires all contributors to sign a contributors license agreement (CLA). This is not scary but essential for open source projects to live beyond projects and individual contributions.

Find all information on our licensing page at http://52north.org/about/licensing/ and our CLA FAQ at http://52north.org/about/licensing/cla-guidelines.

Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes.

Before you start working on a new feature, create a new issue and start a discussion on the mailing list.
We follow the fork & pull development model: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
Use the 52°North code style for Ecplise: https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/Documentation/WebHome#Software_Development
Don't get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around 3 days.


Bug triage
You can help report bugs by filing them here: https://github.com/52North/GeoMetaFacet/issues

Don't forget to check the existing ones first and take a look at the mailing list guidelines - going through these steps makes it likely that you can fix the bug yourself: http://52north.org/resources/mailing-list-and-forums/mailinglist-guidelines
Look at existing bugs and help us understand if the bug is reproducible. Is it reproducible in other environments (browsers)? What are the steps to reproduce?
 
Documentation
All documentation is in the README.md file, now, and a critical read as well as feedback and documentation extensions are always welcome.
 
Community
You can help us making GeoMetaFacet more useful for you by writing your requirements as a user story in the form "As a MY_ROLE, I want MY_GOAL_OR_DESIRE so that A_BENEFIT" and add it as an issue tagged "user story" here: https://github.com/52North/GeoMetaFacet/issues

Tell us about how you use GeoMetaFacet on the community mailing list: http://metadata.forum.52north.org/, metadata@52north.org
